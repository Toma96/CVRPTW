Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

There are six input files containing the number of available vehicles, their capacity, depot position, closing time of depot and all the data on customers (position, serving time, available time interval).
Used algorithms for solving the problem are: greedy search for initial solution and then simulated annealing with parameters specified in parameters.py file.
Make sure to create folder output_files at the same level as the main.py before running the program.
